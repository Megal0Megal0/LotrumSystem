# Health
 A resource depicting a character's physical well being.
 
 The character's Health is equal to their Body [[Stats & Skills#Stats\|stat]].


## Death & Dying

 If Health reaches 0 or lower the character becomes prone and incapable of doing anything but talk and crawl, before that they must roll a Persistence Roll, to perform this roll a [[Stats & Skills#Skills\|Sub Modifier]] of [[Stats & Skills#Stats\|Body]] must be derived, next the player must roll a 1d4 and add the SM, the result is how many turns will pass before the character will perish, during this time the character can be stabilized and saved.
