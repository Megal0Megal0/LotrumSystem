## Lore Slots
Lore Slots are a resource describing a character's potential to remember theoretical knowledge. The number of LS is equal to Mind stat divided by 10 and rounded down.

Lore Slots are filled with *Lore* this can be anything from survival knowledge gathered from experience through a tough life in the wilderness to arcane knowledge learn through rigorous study in a wizard's tower.

Lore can provide a bonus to skill checks when specific theoretical knowledge is applicable and helpful. For example: during a theological debate where your character attempts to sway the opposing party in their views using a Persuasion [[Stats & Skills#Skills\|Skill]] a Theology Lore would provide a boost. Lore does not contain practical skills only theoretical knowledge.
