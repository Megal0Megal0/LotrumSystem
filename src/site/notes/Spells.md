Spells are created from two Words, a primary and a secondary one. Not all combinations are possible and some elements cannot be matched with others under normal circumstances.

### Spellwork

For standard spellcasting called *Spellwork* [[Words of Edict\|Words of Edict]] are used as primary and [[Words of Element\|Words of Element]] as secondary Words. 

To perform a Spellwork the [[Stats & Skills#Skills\|Spellwork Skill]] is not required however in events such as performing magic on an [[Spells#Tags\|Ensouled]] being a Spellwork Skill check determines the chance of success of the Spell.

Performing a Spellwork takes an [[Action\|Action]] and the caster cannot move during that turn.

## Tags
