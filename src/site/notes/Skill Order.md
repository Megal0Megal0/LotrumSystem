If a [[Stats & Skills#Skills\|Skill]] has another Skill as it's [[Stats & Skills#Skills\|Main Modifier]] then it is a Skill of the second order. 
If the MM of a Skill has MM that is also a Skill then that Skill is a Skill of the third order.
In other words for each step a Skill is removed from a base Stat it progresses higher in order. 
The order of a Skill can be shown through the use of superscript (Stealth<sup>2</sup> - meaning), however if the Skill is of the first order that is not necessary.

**A skill may at most be of the 3 order, no higher.**

### Skill Root

A **Skill Root** is simply the base stat that ultimately “powers” a skill’s modifier.

- For a **first-order skill** - one that directly uses a base stat as its Main Modifier - the Skill Root is that base stat.
- For a **higher-order skill** - where the Main Modifier is itself another skill - you determine its Skill Root by following the chain of modifiers until you reach the original base stat.

In short, the Skill Root is the origin of the bonus a skill gets, no matter how many layers of skills separate it from a base stat.
